Rinon clones but with the colors of the Hololive Gamers squad. need I say more?

This is meant to be something I made for fun. I, BladerKev am not attempting to infringe on any copyrights, or ruin anybody's day with these.
Hololive Gamers is owned by COVER corporation. DanceDanceRevolution is owned by Konami Digital Entertainment.
These characters utilize programing and modeling by Enciso0720, DDR Characters And Dancestages team, and Konami Digital Entertainment.
Again, I DID NOT CREATE THESE FOR MALICIOUS INTENTIONS. THIS WAS EXCLUSIVELY FOR FUN.
Please support them by downloading their mods. (You need those mods to use these characters anyways)
(also sorry if there are any typos)
